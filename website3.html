  This piece is designed by one of my favourite design studios Nendo, which is based in Japan. It was designed for the Suntory Museum of Art located in Tokyo. What’s special about the museum is that the exhibition introduces a new concept of display where visitors can choose between two different and distinctive routes: ‘information’ or ‘inspiration’, and this piece of graphic design is right on the wall of the main entrance where visitors make their choices. It simply uses the transformation from ‘information’ to ‘inspiration’ to reach the meaning it wants to say, it’s both succinct and efficient, also very fit to the whole vibe and style of the museum. It can also be widely used on many related products, like tote bag, book cover and so on, which make them like a whole set of products that are related to each other. It tells me that graphic design doesn’t always have to be complicated and include lots of information to reach the gold, sometimes, the simplest design can make the most effect. Also, a good graphic design should not be able to only be used on one place, but can be fit on anything that is related to the project without looking strange.

<div class="w12"><h5>This is a piece of work created by Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, who was a painter and photographer as well as a professor at the Bauhaus school. I don’t only admire this one piece from him, lots of his works have been inspiring and affecting me. Lots of his work remain the same style, but also different in other aspects. I can always see many possibilities that was created on a piece of 2D, flat work. For example, in this piece, I see different color combinations, which leads to overlapping effect. Also, the permutation of the elements makes the whole picture have depth, makes it easy for people to tell the relationship of distance and depth differences of each ele- ment. The various saturation of colors also provides the effect of virtuality vs. reality. The combination on the left seems more real to me than the one on the right.</h5></div>

<div class="w14"><h5>This is a portfolio layout art design I found once on Pinterest. I didn’t know who designed this, but it did inspire me a lot. What attracted me was the combination of the real black and white photographs and the geometric shapes created by the designer. I was surprised that this combi- nation can be very virtually strong and attractive. In my own opinion, the first thing that a good graphic design work should do is to attract people’s attention. I have imagined how it would be if the whole page was just the photograph, I think the designer was very clever to design it this way. What I have learned from this work is that sometimes, some small changes on the origin can make huge differences. Also, less is more. These shapes seem like they are not as strong as the original photographs, but they have definitely made it more like a design, and made the de- sign more interesting and strong.</h5></div>
