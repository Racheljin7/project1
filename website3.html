  This piece is designed by one of my favourite design studios Nendo, which is based in Japan. It was designed for the Suntory Museum of Art located in Tokyo. What’s special about the museum is that the exhibition introduces a new concept of display where visitors can choose between two different and distinctive routes: ‘information’ or ‘inspiration’, and this piece of graphic design is right on the wall of the main entrance where visitors make their choices. It simply uses the transformation from ‘information’ to ‘inspiration’ to reach the meaning it wants to say, it’s both succinct and efficient, also very fit to the whole vibe and style of the museum. It can also be widely used on many related products, like tote bag, book cover and so on, which make them like a whole set of products that are related to each other. It tells me that graphic design doesn’t always have to be complicated and include lots of information to reach the gold, sometimes, the simplest design can make the most effect. Also, a good graphic design should not be able to only be used on one place, but can be fit on anything that is related to the project without looking strange.
